_Create tag_
```console
git tag v1.0.4

```

```console
git push origin v1.0.4

```

### B. Release from Github UI ðŸ’¥

6. After PR is merged from Main to Prod branch, click on edit button and set as "Latest release". This will make it appear as the latest release but will not re-trigger the CDeploy workflow. Which is good because there may be changes in the period between release is created and code is merged to Prod, (if retrigger, then it may not be the one that was in Main to Prod PR) --> but Balqis may be tripping
